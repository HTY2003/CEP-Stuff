Akinjury
=======
This text file is just to point out the uses of all the files.
alexa.json contains the JSON version of our Alexa Dialog Model.
lambda_function.py is the Amazon Lambda function which the responses pass through to create conversation and diagnosis.
location.json is just a helper file for deciphering the various body parts during injury diagnosis.
iCode Poster.pdf is our poster for this product.
database.csv contains the data for injuries and treatment which we based our DynamoDB database upon (to show that we compiled this data ourselves).
Finally, iCode Showcase.mp4 is our video showcasing Akinjury.

Some features(treatments in particular) are missing for now, but that's because we did not realise the deadline had been extended, and we promise to implement the full features.

Hope you enjoy!
